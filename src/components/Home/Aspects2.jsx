        PROJECT MANAGEMENT
      </h2>

      <p className="p">
        Our team at Lush Constructions works collectively with our clients,
        their architect and design team. Along with other trades to guarantee we
        meet the brief to the highest of standards.
      </p>

      <p className="p !py-8">
        As an owner/builder company, from the initial consultation we build
        trusted relationships with our clients. This ensures their understanding
        that they will be dealing with the same people from the start to the
        finish of their project.
      </p>
      <p className="p">
        Throughout the build you will be scheduled onsite meetings during
        various stages of the project as it progresses and evolves. Making sure
        everyone is on the same page or where site constraints may call for an
        alteration in design.
